# Interactive Map (HTML/CSS/JS + Leaflet)

## Overview
This is an interactive web map built using Leaflet.js. It displays multiple points of interest (markers), supports searching by name/category, filtering by category, shows popups with images and descriptions, and includes a geolocation button.

## Files
- `index.html` ‚Äî main UI (map + controls)
- `styles.css` ‚Äî styles and responsive layout
- `script.js` ‚Äî JavaScript: loads `data/locations.json`, creates markers, search & filter, geolocation
- `data/locations.json` ‚Äî marker data (name, lat, lng, category, image)
- `images/` ‚Äî thumbnails used in popups and list

## How to run (sequence-wise execution)
1. **Download / clone** the `interactive-map` folder to your machine.
2. Make sure the folder structure is intact (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `data/locations.json`, `images/`).
3. **Serve locally** (recommended so fetch() works correctly):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` (run inside the project folder).
   - Node: `npx serve .` or use VS Code Live Server.
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown) in your browser.
5. **Test features in order**:
   - Map loads with tiles and markers.
   - Sidebar shows all locations; click a list item to center and open popup.
   - Click markers to see popup (image + description + link to Google Maps).
   - Use the search box to search by name, category or description.
   - Use the category dropdown to filter by category.
   - Click the **üìç My location** button to center the map on your device location (permission requested).
   - Resize the browser to confirm responsive behavior.
6. To **deploy**, push to GitHub and use GitHub Pages, Netlify or Vercel to host.

## Notes
- No API key required ‚Äî uses OpenStreetMap tiles and Leaflet.
- To use Google Maps tiles or Google Places autocomplete you would need API keys and extra code.
